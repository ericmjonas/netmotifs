1. Get simple binary T1xT1 working
2. Extend to generic types
3. Extend to T1xT2, arbitrary relations
4. posterior enumeration-style tests (for T1xT1 there are small number)
5. Hyperparameter inference

We do this with a constant array of suffstats, that sometimes
is too big and so therefor we might have to resize. Oops. 

T1 = create_type(OBJN)
init_type(T1)

type IDs are always contiguous integers

rel = create_relation((T1, T1, T1), 'boolean')
rel.add_data(val, t1_a, t1_b, t1_c)

1. now you can imagine just wanting to perform gibbs sampling
or something like that on the individual types; that is
T1.create_group() passes through to each connected relation


Key of collapsed gibbs sampling

for this type: 
    for every row: 
        Remove the row from the group, and thus the dependent relations
        if the group is empty, keep it around, otherwise, create new empty one
        
        map post_pred across each possible group
        
        Gibbs
        assign
        
        good

a relation can then have the following options on it


                  
IRM:
for type in types:
    gibbs_sample(type)
    hp_inference(type)
